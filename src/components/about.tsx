                    Hi, I&apos;m Alexander Gervais, a passionate Software Engineer with a
                    Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Fitchburg State University,
                    where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in December 2024. I have a strong
                    foundation in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++,
                    and hands-on experience in frameworks like React, Svelte, and Django,
                    which allows me to bring both creativity and technical precision to
                    every project I undertake.
                </p>
                </BlurFade>
                <BlurFade delay={0.25}>
                <p>
                    In addition to my academic achievements, I&apos;ve honed my skills through
                    impactful projects such as developing SubGenGUI, a Python-based GUI tool
                    that streamlines subtitle generation for content creators, and building
                    the Cosmic Boogeyman website, which leverages SvelteKit to boost online
                    engagement.

                    As a freelance web developer, I specialize in creating visually
                    compelling, responsive websites tailored to client needs. My approach
                    combines technical expertise with a commitment to delivering scalable
                    and user-friendly solutions. Beyond web development, I have a proven
                    track record as a computer repair technician, where I&apos;ve resolved
                    hardware and software issues for hundreds of clients, earning a 95%
                    customer satisfaction rate.

                <p>
                    When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy diving into personal projects,
                    experimenting with new technologies, and spending time with friends. My
                    goal is to build innovative solutions that make a difference, whether
                    it&apos;s enhancing user experience, improving system performance, or
                    creating tools that simplify complex workflows.
